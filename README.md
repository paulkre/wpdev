# wpdev

A library for developing modern WordPress themes. It contains both PHP and JavaScript code, so it is necessary to utilize two different package managers. [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) is used for PHP and [NPM](https://npmjs.com) for JavaScript.

## Installation

PHP:

```bash
composer require paulkre/wpdev
```

JavaScript:

```bash
npm install @paulkre/wpdev
```
